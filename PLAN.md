# Form Builder SaaS Implementation Plan

This document captures the high-level tracks, scope, and actionable stubs needed to deliver the multi-tenant form builder platform described in the product brief.

## 1. Platform architecture & multi-tenant foundation
- Define the tenant model (Super Admin, Business Admins, unauthenticated respondents) and isolate tenant data in Supabase using Row Level Security and tenant-scoped schemas.
- Implement a session-aware API layer (Next.js App Router + Supabase auth helpers) that maps users to their businesses and enforces access boundaries.
- Establish configuration storage for per-business branding, form settings, and admin permissions.

:::task-stub{title="Lay down multi-tenant architecture on Supabase + Next.js"}
1. Scaffold Next.js (App Router) with Supabase auth helpers.
2. Design Supabase schema: businesses, business_admins, forms, form_fields, responses, response_events.
3. Configure Row Level Security policies and tenant-aware middleware in Next.js API routes.
4. Implement Super Admin dashboard skeleton for managing businesses/admins.
:::

## 2. Visual form builder UI with drag-and-drop & component library
- Choose a component library that plays well with Next.js (e.g., shadcn/ui + drag-and-drop toolkit like dnd-kit).
- Build reusable field components (text, choice, file upload, signature, etc.) with customizable settings panels.
- Persist form structure as JSON schema-like documents in Supabase; include versioning for form drafts vs. published copies.

:::task-stub{title="Create visual form builder experience"}
1. Integrate drag-and-drop editor using dnd-kit (form canvas, palette, settings sidebar).
2. Implement field schema definitions and corresponding configurable React components.
3. Build form persistence APIs: save drafts, publish versions, clone, and preview.
4. Add Super Admin override to inspect/edit any businessâ€™s forms.
:::

## 3. Conditional logic & database lookup
- Provide a no-code rule builder (if/then UI) for admins to define logic based on field responses and Supabase queries.
- Implement serverless functions to evaluate rules, including the initial lookup (first name/last name/phone) and auto-skip if within cooldown window.
- Allow branching between cards/pages and auto-fill/hide behaviors based on rule outcomes.

:::task-stub{title="Implement visual rule builder and data lookups"}
1. Design rule builder UI (conditions, actions) with validation and preview.
2. Store rules in Supabase (JSON logic schema) tied to form versions.
3. Create serverless endpoints to execute rules, including Supabase lookups.
4. Wire client runtime to react to rule outcomes (skip pages, prefill, show/hide).
:::

## 4. Form runtime & submission handling
- Generate live forms from the stored schema; support authenticated admins previewing and unauthenticated respondents filling forms.
- Handle signature capture, autosave, and resuming via secure tokens.
- Record submissions, track statuses, and log events (viewed, started, skipped).

:::task-stub{title="Deliver respondent experience and submission pipeline"}
1. Build form renderer that consumes schema + rules.
2. Add autosave/resume flow with secure tokens or magic links.
3. Store submissions + metadata, linking to business and form version.
4. Implement cooldown check: skip re-entry if submission is recent.
:::

## 5. Analytics dashboard & exports
- Create dashboards for admins with submission counts, completion rates, and per-field analytics.
- Include filters by date, submission status, and respondent attributes.
- Provide CSV export (download) and optional webhook integrations for real-time forwarding.

:::task-stub{title="Ship analytics and export tooling"}
1. Design Supabase views or analytics tables aggregating metrics.
2. Build dashboard UI (charts, tables) using a React charting library.
3. Implement CSV export endpoints respecting tenant isolation.
4. Add webhook configuration UI + delivery worker (Edge function / cron).
:::

## 6. Deployment, environments, and CI/CD
- Configure Vercel for frontend (Next.js) with environment segregation (dev/staging/prod).
- Use Supabase for DB/auth/storage; set up migrations via Supabase CLI or Prisma.
- Establish CI checks (lint, tests) and preview deployments for PRs.

:::task-stub{title="Set up deployment pipeline and environments"}
1. Configure Supabase project, secrets, and migrations workflow.
2. Hook Next.js project into Vercel with environment variables per stage.
3. Implement GitHub Actions for linting/testing and Vercel preview comments.
4. Document onboarding steps for new developers.
:::

## 7. Security, compliance, and scalability considerations
- Enforce encryption, secure session management, and audit logging.
- Plan for rate limiting, input sanitization, and monitoring (Sentry/Logflare).
- Outline roadmap items for future features (payment, integrations, custom domains).

:::task-stub{title="Address security, monitoring, and future-proofing"}
1. Add audit logging schema and middleware for admin actions.
2. Configure monitoring/alerting (e.g., Logflare + Vercel, Supabase logs).
3. Implement rate limiting and field validation defenses.
4. Draft roadmap for future modules (custom domains, payments, integrations).
