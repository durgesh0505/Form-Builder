# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rabbit-forms.git
cd rabbit-forms

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Set up Supabase (see README.md)
# Then start the dev server

```

### Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js App Router pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # React components

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow the component structure:

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onSubmit: (data: string) => void;
}

export function MyComponent({ title, onSubmit }: MyComponentProps) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### File Naming

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `FormBuilder.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `exportCsv.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `FormSchema.ts`)

#### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Keep custom CSS minimal

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
feat: add signature field support
fix: resolve duplicate submission bug
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: simplify conditional logic engine
test: add tests for form builder
chore: update dependencies
```

### Branch Naming

- Feature: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/signature-field`)
- Bug fix: `fix/description` (e.g., `fix/duplicate-check`)
- Documentation: `docs/description`
- Refactor: `refactor/description`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- FormBuilder.test.tsx

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Write component tests for UI components
- Write integration tests for critical flows
- Use meaningful test descriptions

Example:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { FormBuilder } from './FormBuilder';

describe('FormBuilder', () => {
  it('should render field palette', () => {
    render(<FormBuilder />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Text Field')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should add field to canvas on drag and drop', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
